## Lesson Learned/ Challenges

<u>*Challenges*</u>

Spent alot of time recreating the ERD to fit most of the useable data columns

Shopify API: Was able to get it work in PowerBI but could not connect the actual path to ons.db in python script 

<u>*Lesson Learned*</u>

Using sqlite to create a small compress database as a flat file that can be shared

Converting files from excel to csv to sql_table

be able to run sql anywhere even without a sql extension software like my sql workbench
